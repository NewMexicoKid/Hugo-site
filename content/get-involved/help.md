## How to help Writing Quests

Writing Quests is the creation of volunteers from around the world. 
Here is how you can contribute your creativity to help us further develop the Writing Quests Framework, Guide, and other assets (e.g., badge sets, etc).


## Contributors Agreement

Writing Quests requires the agreement from its Contributors to assign non-exclusive rights to what the Contributors create and give to the Writing Quests Association. This allows Writing Quests to make its Framework and other assets available under the [Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Sharealike 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en).

A downloadable PDF will be linked here in the next two weeks for Contributors to use to document their agreement with this policy.
