Badges are earned via Writing Quests. If you have an idea for a badge or are an artist wanting to volunteer to create a badge, please [contact us](/get-involved/help/).

A great way to track your progress during a Writing Quest is by using a Word Count Tracker. Writing Quests is making two trackers available today:

* A [view-only google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zsjBv1wG4HquO-azqirvdHXDLQRak067?usp=sharing:) with the [Writing Quests Progress Tracker](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qUSBlYEVbFf8jbrorG7CvaaDJ_3oz8uu) (*based on google sheets*) and [Writing Quests Aggregator](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qUSBlYEVbFf8jbrorG7CvaaDJ_3oz8uu) (*also based on google sheets*)
* The *beta* version of [Questy](https://questy.writingquests.org), the web-based tracker.

Outside of Writing Quests, We've also seen many users of [trackbear.app](https://trackbear.app) that promises to be free forever, boasting an impressive feauture set and the ability to support community progress graphs (leader boards).

We have begun documenting the best practices for Quest Guides (the volunteers who coordinate the Writing Quests and make them come alive for the Quest participants). See [The Write Recipe](/the_write_recipe_v20241030.pdf).
