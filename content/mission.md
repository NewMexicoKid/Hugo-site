## Mission Statement<a id="mission-statement"></a>

The Writing Quests mission is to provide writing groups with a flexible framework that can be used to generate writing challenges at any time of the year.


## Vision<a id="writing-quests-vision"></a>

We are building a flexible framework for generating writing challenges; and we are preparing the assets (graphical elements, badges, marketing materials) and infrastructure (website to host) so that any writing community that wants to host a writing challenge (any month and with other options they can select) can point to our hosted rules and won't need to create their own challenges from scratch.

The Writing Quests Framework is a modifiable, shareable structure for defining a creative writing/art challenge. The idea is that people can make a 'copy' of that base structure and fill in the blanks. This is essentially a build-your-own challenge kit.

## Writing Quests Values<a id="writng-quests-values"></a>

Our Values focus on helping people tell their stories
Writing Quests aims to facilitate communities worldwide in setting out on a shared adventure of creativity, discovery, and support.

There is nothing more human than telling a story. Stories define cultures, give us identity, explain the world, and help us make sense of our experiences. They can capture us, trap us, or transform us. Considering their power, Writing Quests aims to enable every person to find their voice and tell their own story.

While we believe humans can achieve amazing things independently, we can achieve even more if we work together. A writer does not need to be alone at their desk. We embrace and encourage communities of openness, plurality, and diversity. We believe any form of creativity needs an inclusive and accepting environment to grow and shine. We can all achieve so much more when we support each other.

This framework aims to tell stories of love and loss, injustice, success and failure, beginnings and endings, and hope and despair. It also includes stories of humans, monsters, cyborgs, aliens, animals, and angels. Sad stories, happy stories, tragic stories, and comical stories—any story is worth telling, and every writer deserves a community to support them in their quest.
