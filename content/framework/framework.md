# Writing Quests Framework

Available Rules for Setting up a Writing Quest

Purpose of Writing Quests
=========================

Writing Quests provides tools, resources, and a framework to motivate writers
and writing groups to articulate their ideas, build worlds, and bring them to
life in a supportive way. Our unique framework is designed to ignite the spark
of creation in both individual writers and collaborative writing groups.

Embark with us on a creative quest to support writers of all levels,
offering motivation and the challenge of achieving a substantial goal to
engage your writing community. While Writing Quests is by name geared
towards writing, other endeavors can also tell a story. Please consider
how this framework can be adapted towards art, illustration and other
graphic challenges.

Dive into an immersive experience that encourages you to articulate your
ideas with clarity and creativity. With our support, building vibrant
worlds and compelling narratives becomes not just possible but
incredibly fun!

Whether crafting epic tales or fleshing out intricate backstories,
Writing Quests makes the creation process a delightful adventure. Join
us in this fun-filled endeavor to turn your imaginative visions into
reality, one quest at a time. Let\'s make writing an exciting
exploration of endless possibilities!

About Us
========

The designers of Writing Quests bring a wealth of experience from their
extensive involvement in creative writing communities and events. Their
decades of experience stem from roles such as organizers of writing
groups and long-term volunteers for an annual international creative
event to write a novel in 30 days, National Novel Writing Month.
 

Our Values focus on helping people tell their stories
=====================================================

Writing Quests aims to facilitate communities worldwide in setting out
on a shared adventure of creativity, discovery, and support.

There is nothing more human than telling a story. Stories define
cultures, give us identity, explain the world, and help us make sense of
our experiences. They can capture us, trap us, or transform us.
Considering their power, Writing Quests aims to enable every person to
find their voice and tell their own story.

While we believe humans can achieve amazing things independently, we can
achieve even more if we work together. A writer does not need to be
alone at their desk. We embrace and encourage communities of openness,
plurality, and diversity. We believe any form of creativity needs an
inclusive and accepting environment to grow and shine. We can all
achieve so much more when we support each other.

This framework aims to tell stories of love and loss, injustice, success
and failure, beginnings and endings, and hope and despair. It also
includes stories of humans, monsters, cyborgs, aliens, animals, and
angels. Sad stories, happy stories, tragic stories, and comical
stories---any story is worth telling, and every writer deserves a
community to support them in their quest.

Objectives 
===========

Writing Quests are designed to be flexible and user-friendly, catering
to a wide audience while allowing individual customization.

* **Universality:** The Quest Rules are designed to be applicable
  across various international contexts without being limited by
  regional or cultural specifics.
* **Purpose:** The Quest Rules support, motivate, and encourage
  participants and provide a sense of comradery for what is normally
  considered a solo endeavor.
* **Conciseness and Specificity:** The Quest Rules aim to be concise
  to ensure they are easily understandable and specific enough to
  provide clear guidance.
* **Accessibility:** A general version of the Quest Rules will be
  available as a preview to satisfy all potential participants\'
  curiosity and initial interest.
* **Customization:** The Quest Rules will be tailored to each
  community's quest through a Google form, ensuring they are
  relevant to its specific details and requirements.
* **Shareable**: Writing Quests offers this framework under [[Creative

Awards

Why does Writing Quest offer digital certificates and virtual badges?

  providing writers with tangible indicators of their achievements
  and motivate them to continue their Quest.

  with an understanding of what they've accomplished and incentive
  to continue to the next goal.

Certificates

Writing Quests offers a high-quality digital copy of a printable
certificate that can be shared online as a testament to the

Badges 
-------

Writing Quests offers participants a virtual badge system as a digital
recognition program that celebrates and showcases writers\' achievements
as they complete various milestones within the quests.

Each badge will have a unique design, representing the specific
achievement visually. Participants can display their badges on their
profiles or share them on social media to celebrate their progress and
accomplishments in the Writing Quests community. This system motivates
participants to engage and progress and provides a fun way to visually
track and display their writing journey.

Over time, Writing Quests intends to expand its badge library to align
with additional quest types and milestones.

group that will manage the Writing Quest. A guide can be anyone

environment conducive to creativity and collaboration.

Quests
======

Required Elements to Establish a Writing Quest
----------------------------------------------

### Quest Name

> What is the name of your quest?

### Host 

> Who will be administering this Writing Quest? It could be a person or
> the name of the writing group.

### Writing Group Name

> What writing group is participating? Please include contact
> information and who is allowed to participate. E.g., will you welcome
> virtual participants from outside your writing group?

### Time frame 

The Quest host selects a period for the Writing Quest.

> To ensure everyone gets a fair shot at showcasing their creativity,
> it's recommended that any writing quest should ideally last between
> one and two months. This duration strikes the perfect balance to keep
> things exciting. Shorter quests make it easier for new members to jump
> right into the action without having to wait too long. Plus, those who
> might have fallen a bit behind can catch up or start fresh on a new
> quest without feeling left out.
>
> Keeping quests concise also helps participants stay focused on the end
> goal, making the creation process more achievable and less daunting.
> Imagine being part of an ever-evolving story where you and your fellow
> creators are always within reach of victory! This way, every quest
> remains a fun adventure in storytelling, ensuring fairness and
> enjoyment for all involved.
>
> However, the option for a longer quest is available through the
> Writing Quest framework for those who want to commit to an odyssey.

A host can also set up a series of Quests for participants. A proposed
series may be:

* January - plotting for one month
* February to March - writing for a month or two
* April to May - editing for a month or two

### Available Quest Types

* Novels, novellas, short stories, flash fiction
* Memoirs
* Screenplays
* Nonfiction works
* Poetry
* Art/Graphic art

### Progress Tracking 

Embarking on a writing quest is not just about the creative eruption of
words onto a page; it involves tracking one\'s advancement, which acts
as a robust fountain of motivation for those participating. This
feedback loop informs writers about their pace towards achieving their
literary goal. Those with a competitive spark can channel this energy
effectively by juxtaposing their progress with fellow adventurers in
creation.

The journey toward writing mastery is guided by four primary metric
systems that ensure fairness and clarity in measuring each
participant\'s achievements. These metrics serve as signposts, directing
every writer through the realms of imagination and dedication. Engaging
in this friendly competition not only spurs writers to push beyond their
limits but also adds an element of excitement to the otherwise solitary
quest to bring stories to life.

1. **Word Count:** Those embarking on the creative quest of writing can
   monitor their burgeoning word count as they craft new drafts,
   ensuring every word toward their masterpiece is accounted for.
   This brings a sense of fairness and accomplishment to their
   journey, as each word penned is a step closer to their goal.

2. **Hours:**

    a.  **Editing:** For those in the realm of editing, the adventure
        doesn\'t end with drafting. You too can track the hours
        dedicated to refining and perfecting your work, ensuring that
        every edit brings you closer to perfection.

    b.  **Art and Graphic Art:** For the brave souls venturing into
        creating new artwork. Your quest is marked by hours spent in
        creation, each moment devoted to bringing your vision to life.
        This way of tracking ensures that every hour contributes
        palpably towards achieving your artistic aspirations.

3.  **Days:** Will the quest solidify a new daily habit? Why not dive
    into the creative pool of possibilities with just 15 or 30 minutes
    daily. This is not just about keeping time; it's about writing a
    thrilling new chapter where consistency meets creation. Whether
    penning thoughts, sketching, or even learning a new skill, this
    compact yet powerful chunk of time can transform these moments
    into a joyful journey.

4.  **Percent:** For those aspiring to personal achievement, especially
    in writing and creation, the quest's goal can be tracked as a
    percentage of the completion target. Picture this: the mission is
    to craft an epic tale of 100,000 words. The journey from the first
    word to the 100,000th is not just about reaching the end but
    celebrating each milestone along the way. Setting a goal divides
    the grand adventure into manageable segments, allowing someone to
    track their voyage through the realm of creativity.

One transforms an abstract endeavor into a quantifiable quest by
measuring the current word count against that ambitious target of
100,000 words. This normalization---this magical formula---not only
personalizes progress but also introduces an element of fairness when
benching one writing's achievements against fellow adventurers who\'ve
chosen to participate in similar quests.

In essence, it turns what could be an overwhelming journey into a fun
and measurable expedition toward completing your masterpiece. Through
this approach, each writer\'s path becomes uniquely their own while
fostering a sense of community and shared triumph among those
navigating their creations\' challenges. This method doesn\'t just
quantify success; it celebrates every step toward achieving one\'s
literary dream.

Please feel free to adapt Writing Quest sample trackers for your
challenge. There is also a space available for you to personalize the
tracker with your group's logo for hosting the Quest.

Awarding Badges
===============

The Writing Quest Badge system is designed to celebrate and track
writers\' progress during the particular Writing Quest.

The badge levels depend on the badge set chosen by the Writing Quest
Guide. Guides should choose badge sets that best align with their
writing community's goals and show achievement in a meaningful way.

Guides should review the Writing Quest badge library before making a
choice. Depending on the current library, sets with additional badges
may be awarded at different achievement levels or for guides,
cheerleaders, overachievers, or attendees at specific in-person events.

An example of a 40,000-word Writing Quest with a five-badge set would
be:

1.  First word written
2.  Reached 10,000 words
3.  Reached 20,000 words
4.  Reached 30,000 words
5.  Winner - wrote 40,000 words

Initial badges will be embedded within the word tracking spreadsheets to
be awarded when each tier is reached. However, due to the flexibility of
Writing Quests' rules framework, further customization may be needed by
the Guide. Please refer to The Write Recipe, Writing Quests handbook of
tips and tricks for Guides.
