## Mission Statement<a id="mission-statement"></a>

To bring together a creative collaborative community through quests.


## What is Writing Quests?<a id="what-is-writing-quests"></a>

Writing Quests is the following:

- An Association of leaders of writing communities around the globe, most of whom were inspired by the original National Novel Writing Month (aka NaNoWriMo) and the concept created by Chris Baty–motivating writers everywhere to accomplish their dreams and write their novels while having fun doing it in the community of fellow writers.

- A Framework of rules, guidelines, and supporting assets (such as trackers and virtual badges) to support writing groups and communities who would like to host their own Writing Quests.

- An organization promoting creativity and the love of writing through the facilitation of quests to motivate writers.


## How Can I Get Involved?<a id="how-can-i-get-involved"></a>

Quest Guides- The people who host the Writing Quests are called Quest Guides.  They will help creatives through the process of setting goals, prepping for the quests, and provide encouragement during the event. Click on Get Involved> The Framework to get started.

## Why Writing Quests?<a id="why-writing-quests"></a>

Writing Quests aims to facilitate communities worldwide in setting out on a shared adventure of creativity, discovery, and support.  Writing Quests was made for use by communities to assist in the prepping, creation, and running of writing events.  We have Guidebooks to help Guides create an event, host the event, and grow their communities.
