## What is Writing Quests?<a id="what-is-writing-quests"></a>

Writing Quests is the following:

- An Association of almost seventy leaders of writing communities around the globe, most of whom were inspired by the original National Novel Writing Month (aka NaNoWriMo) and the concept created by Chris Baty–motivating writers everywhere to accomplish their dreams and write their novels while having fun doing it in the community of fellow writers.

- A Framework of rules, guidelines, and supporting assets (such as trackers and virtual badges) to support writing groups and communities who would like to host their own Writing Quests.

- An organization promoting creativity and the love of writing through the facilitation of quests to motivate writers.

## Vision<a id="writing-quests-vision"></a>

We are building a flexible framework for generating writing challenges; and we are preparing the assets (graphical elements, badges, marketing materials) and infrastructure (website to host) so that any writing community that wants to host a writing challenge (any month and with other options they can select) can point to our hosted rules and won't need to create their own challenges from scratch.

The Writing Quests Framework is a modifiable, shareable structure for defining a creative writing/art challenge. The idea is that people can make a 'copy' of that base structure and fill in the blanks. This is essentially a build-your-own challenge kit.

## Why Writing Quests?<a id="why-writing-quests"></a>

Writing Quests aims to facilitate communities worldwide in setting out on a shared adventure of creativity, discovery, and support.  Writing Quests was made for use by communities to assist in the prepping, creation, and running of writing events.  We have Guidebooks to help Guides create an event, host the event, and grow their communities. 

## How Can I Get Involved?<a id="how-can-i-get-involved"></a>

Quest Guides- The people who host the Writing Quests are called Quest Guides.  They will help creatives through the process of setting goals, prepping for the quests, and provide encouragement during the event. 

Participants- Anyone can participate even if you are not a writer.  A list of participating groups will be shared here.. 

Volunteers- Writing Quests is an all volunteer organization.  If you want to volunteer, please [fill out our form](/get-involved/help/) and let us know your experience and if applicable,  what you are looking to help with.
