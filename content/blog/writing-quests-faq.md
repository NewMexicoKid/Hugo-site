What is Writing Quests?
-----------------------

Writing Quests is

-   An Association of leaders of writing communities around the globe,
    most of whom were inspired by the original National Novel Writing
    Month (aka NaNoWriMo) and the concept created by Chris
    Baty--motivating writers everywhere to accomplish their dreams and
    write their novels while having fun doing it in the community of
    fellow writers.
-   A Framework of rules, guidelines, and supporting assets (such as
    trackers and virtual badges) to support writing groups and
    communities who would like to host their own writing quests.
-   An organization promoting creativity and the love of writing through
    the facilitation of quests to motivate writers.

Who is Writing Quests for? How is it used?
------------------------------------------

Writing Quests is primarily for the organizers of writing groups and
writing communities who seek to host a writing challenge. We are
providing the rule framework and necessary supporting pieces to hosts to
make it easier and more fulfilling for them and their groups to enjoy a
better writing challenge experience.

To that effect, we will provide:

-   A flexible rules generator to allow hosts to customize their writing
    challenge (or quest as we call it)
-   A guide for hosts that is built up from years of experience from
    former NaNoWriMo Municipal Liaisons
-   Graphical assets such as inspirational badges (which will play a
    bigger motivational role in the WQ framework)
-   A tracker for the progress of the quest participant.

What Writing Quests is not
--------------------------

Writing Quests (WQ) is **not** NaNoWriMo and has no aspirations to replace
NaNoWriMo, even though WQ is NaNo-compatible. WQ has no large central
organization and has no intentions to seek out non-profit status or to apply
for financial grants. WQ provides the Framework to enable others to host their
own Quests.

What does NaNo-compatible mean?
-------------------------------

Although WQ has several differences from NaNoWriMo, guides can choose
start and end dates, along with word count tracking, to have a local
Writing Quest that aligns with NaNoWriMo participation.

Why are you doing this?
-----------------------

We love writing; and we've seen the joy that comes from helping writing
challenge participants complete their novel drafts. Properly done,
socially-enabled writing quests can be tremendously fulfilling
experiences. We want to draw upon our experiences to make these
challenges more widely accessible to potential participants.

What values do you hold?
------------------------

Writing Quests aims to facilitate communities worldwide in setting out
on a shared adventure of creativity, discovery, and support.

There is nothing more human than telling a story. Stories define
cultures, give us identity, explain the world to us, and help us make
sense of our experiences. They can capture us, trap us, or transform us.
In light of their power, Writing Quests aims to enable every person to
find their voice and tell their own story.

While we believe humans can achieve amazing things independently, we can
achieve even more if we work together. A writer does not need to be
alone at their desk. We embrace and encourage communities of openness,
plurality, and diversity. We believe any form of creativity needs an
inclusive and accepting environment to grow and shine. We can all
achieve so much more when we support each other.

This framework aims to tell stories of love and loss, injustice, success
and failure, beginnings and endings, and hope and despair. It also
includes stories of humans, monsters, cyborgs, aliens, animals, and
angels. Sad stories, happy stories, tragic stories, and comical
stories---any story is worth telling, and every writer deserves a
community to support them in their quest.

What are quests?
----------------

This is the Writing Quests term for a writing challenge.

## Why did you choose this term?

It seemed appropriate for what we (and the actual Quest host) are offering:
there is an objective (e.g., 50,000+ word novel draft in 30 days or 50 hours of
editing in a month) that many participants share (many people can share the
same Quest) but there is also an individual aspect to it--each participant
embarks on their own individual Quest and experiences their own journey.

Note: you don't have to be into fantasy or historical adventures or role
playing games to participate in a writing quest.

Can anyone create/host a Writing Quest?
---------------------------------------

Yes. The Writing Quest Framework is available for all to use.

How do I create a Writing Quest?
--------------------------------

Step One: Read our Write Recipe Book (*coming soon*) to learn how to prepare for a Quest. 

Step Two: Use our graphics to create promotional
material.

Step Three: Promote your Quest. Share your Quest via social media.

Step Four: Contact us to add your Event to the Quests page.

**Important note**: we are intending to be usable November 2024.

What is the Writing Quest Framework?
------------------------------------

A Framework includes rules, guidelines, and supporting assets (such as
trackers and virtual badges) to support writing groups and communities
who would like to host their own Writing Quests. Read more about our
Rules, Write Recipe book, and Assets.

Is Writing Quests associated with NaNoWriMo?
--------------------------------------------

No, although most of the WQ creators formerly were NaNoWriMo Municipal
Liaison volunteers.

Can other creatives make or join a Quest?
-----------------------------------------

Yes! There are alternate metrics that might be more appropriate to use
for tracking progress (e.g., hours spent) if you are, for
instance, creating graphical artwork or writing individual poems.

Do the Writing Quests get reviewed or approved by anyone?
---------------------------------------------------------

WQ reviews the usage data for its Framework and will, if the host opts
in, list pointers on the writingquests.org site to the hosted quest if
appropriate.

No formal review/approval is required to use the Writing Quests
Framework.

What do you get when you win a quest?
-------------------------------------

Mostly it's about the joy of completing your novel draft/editing goal
and the satisfaction of appreciating what you've created. There's
something also to be said about the friends you've made along the way.

WQ also provides virtual badges and certificates.

How much does it cost to join/host?
-----------------------------------

Absolutely nothing. Use of Writing Quests is free for everyone.

What are badges for?
--------------------

These are motivational aids, awarded for achieving different milestones
in the pursuit of a quest objective.

How can I find quests in my area?
---------------------------------

We are planning to add a directory on our website where planned and in-progress
quests will be linked. There will also be a calendar in the directory where you
can see in progress events from other groups.

I don\'t write in English, can I still join?
--------------------------------------------

Yes! While we are continuing to add internationalization support to our
materials, our intention is to serve all interested writing communities
globally.

Background
----------

Due to changes in the leadership and policies of National Novel Writing
Month (NaNoWriMo), the Municipal Liaison volunteers from many NaNoWriMo
regions decided to leave the organization. Our writing communities still
enjoy a NaNo-style challenge, but several no longer wish to do
NaNoWriMo. We collectively decided to put together our own framework for
hosting an annual writing challenge. As we have gone through this
exercise, it has grown clear to us that

-   There are a number of improvements we can make over what NaNoWriMo
    provides (e.g., some additional motivations for participants)
-   Some of the partner organizations for our writing communities (e.g.,
    libraries) want to continue working with the NaNoWriMo Come Write
    In program but also strongly want to continue their association
    with our writing communities. Thus, it is imperative that the
    Writing Quests Framework be ***NaNo-compatible*** even as it is
    something new.
-   There are some current MLs for NaNoWriMo regions who would benefit
    from using the Writing Quests Framework in their efforts to put on
    local programming for NaNoWriMo.

We have moved forward in building collaboratively the framework and
shared assets that would be the most helpful for writing community
leaders in hosting their own writing challenges.
